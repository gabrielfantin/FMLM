# FMLM Progress Documentation

This document tracks the status of features planned and implemented in the FMLM app. Each feature is listed with its current implementation status.

## Project Setup

**Package Manager:** Yarn (v1.22.22)
- ✅ Migrated from npm to Yarn
- ✅ Dependencies installed and working
- ✅ Dev server running successfully with `yarn tauri dev`

**Styling & Icons:**
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4.1 configured with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- ✅ Lucide Vue Next for icon components
- ✅ CSS imported in src/style.css with `@import "tailwindcss"`
- ✅ All components refactored to use Tailwind utilities (removed ~400+ lines of custom CSS)
- ✅ All SVG icons replaced with Lucide components (FolderOpen, Check, Loader2, Image, Play, AlertCircle)

**Rust Backend:**
- ✅ Code reviewed and updated to follow Rust best practices and guidelines
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation added (module, function, and example docs)
- ✅ Expanded test coverage from 1 to 6 unit tests + 1 doctest
- ✅ Added common trait implementations (PartialEq, Eq, Copy, Default)
- ✅ Extracted helper functions for better code organization
- ✅ Passes all quality checks: `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy` (zero warnings)
- ✅ Updated Cargo.toml with proper metadata (license, repository, keywords, categories)

**Database:**
- ✅ SQLite integration with sqlx for async operations
- ✅ Database stored in user's system Tauri app data directory
- ✅ Automatic migrations on app startup
- ✅ Three main tables: scanned_folders, media_metadata, user_preferences
- ✅ Full CRUD operations via Tauri commands
- ✅ Connection pooling for performance
- ✅ Foreign key constraints and indexes for data integrity
- ✅ Stores media metadata (dimensions, duration, file info, thumbnails)
- ✅ Stores user preferences and settings
- ✅ Tracks scanned folders with last scan time and file counts

**Commands:**
- `yarn install` - Install dependencies
- `yarn dev` - Start Vite dev server only
- `yarn tauri dev` - Start full Tauri app in dev mode
- `yarn build` - Build for production

## Phase 1: Core Viewing and Browsing

### Thumbnail Grid View (FR-3.2): In Progress (Base Implementation Complete)

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Directory selection with native dialog (Tauri plugin-dialog)
- ✅ Recursive directory scanning for image and video files
- ✅ Support for multiple image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, webp, heic, heif, tiff, svg)
- ✅ Support for multiple video formats (mp4, mov, avi, mkv, webm, flv, wmv, m4v, mpg, mpeg)
- ✅ Responsive CSS Grid layout (1-2 cols mobile, 4-6 cols desktop)
- ✅ File metadata extraction (size, modified date, file type)
- ✅ Direct file display using Tauri's convertFileSrc
- ✅ Video preview with play icon overlay
- ✅ File type badges (Image/Video)
- ✅ Empty state messaging
- ✅ Loading states with spinner
- ✅ Error handling and display
- ✅ **Working Folders Sidebar:**
  - Left sidebar menu displaying tracked folders
  - "Add Folder" button to scan new directories
  - Folder list with name, path, and file count
  - Click to load folder contents
  - "Forget" button to remove folders from tracking
  - Folders automatically saved to SQLite database
  - Visual indication of currently selected folder
  - Persistent folder history across app sessions

**Pending (Future Iterations):**
- ⏳ Thumbnail generation (currently displaying full files)
- ⏳ Hover zoom/preview functionality
- ⏳ Sort by date controls (currently sorts newest first by default)
- ⏳ Full-screen slideshow mode
- ⏳ Virtual scrolling for performance with 1000+ files
- ⏳ Keyboard navigation

**Technical Stack:**
- Rust: `image`, `walkdir`, `serde`, `chrono`
- Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- Tauri plugins: `dialog`, `fs`
